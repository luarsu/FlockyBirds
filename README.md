# FlockyBirds
Flocky Birds is a prototype of a game where the player needs to guide a flock of birds to collect objects, increase the size of the flock and avoid obstacles to prevent them from dying. To interact with the flock, the player will be constantly creating different kinds of stimuli that will make the flock react differently, like the positive (that attracts them) and negative (that repels them) ones, among others.

# Play the game & modify it

Please click on the Clone or download button and afterwards, press the Download ZIP button.

Once the ZIP file is downloaded, decompress it and place the file wherever you consider to be best. After this last step is completed, go to FlockAIGame\Assets\Scene and open the InitScene file. By doing that, the unity project with the main game scene will be opened.

The game can be played and changed inside the Unity editor, but the ZIP file also contains a standalone version of the game. To just play the game, please go to FlockAIGame\Builds\Windows and execute the FlockyBirds.exe file.  That will open a game window that can be played full screen and having to open Unity.

# Game controls:

Right click: Create a positive stimulus that will attract the birds close to it.
Left Click: Create a negative stimulus that will repel the birds.
